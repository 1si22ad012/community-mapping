# Community mapping  and Air Quality Analysis Dashboard
**Objective**
Our challenge is to creatively model our community using a map that incorporates open-source science datasets and then use that map to explore how an issue in our community is shaped by the surrounding physical geography.

**Project Description**

Developed a dashboard which  integrates  air quality data with GIS to visualize pollution impacts and track health trends. It provides actionable insights for communities and authorities to address environmental concerns.

**Map Integration**:
 A map that displays the locations of air quality monitoring stations, along with data on air quality levels in different regions.

**Air Quality Index (AQI):**
Display of the AQI for various pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, O3, etc., to give users a snapshot of air quality.

**Vulnerable Areas:** 
Helps to Identify  areas with high vulnerability, where air quality may have a larger health impact.
