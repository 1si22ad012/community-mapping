# Community mapping  and Air Quality Analysis Dashboard
**Objective**

This project leverages spatial visualization and real-time open-source datasets to analyze how air quality affects local communities. By mapping air quality monitoring data onto a digital dashboard, it empowers residents and authorities to recognize vulnerable areas and take informed environmental actions.

üß† Purpose & Vision
The primary aim is to:

Raise awareness about air pollution in the community.

Provide scientific data in an intuitive visual form.

Help identify pollution hotspots and health-vulnerable zones.

Instead of using traditional borders, the community is defined as places of everyday interaction‚Äîresidences, roads, schools, and shared spaces that collectively form the ‚Äúhome environment.‚Äù

üó∫Ô∏è Key Features
Interactive Map Integration: Displays geolocated AQI data using spatial mapping tools.

Air Quality Index (AQI):

Tracks pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ, and O‚ÇÉ.

Color-coded markers indicate current air quality levels.

Vulnerable Area Mapping:

Highlights hospitals, schools, and densely populated zones more prone to pollution impacts.

Open-Source Data Usage:

Pulls data from platforms like OpenAQ and NASA EarthData (e.g., Sentinel-5P).

May incorporate demographic and health vulnerability data from WHO or census APIs.

Community Impact Reports:

Visual trends (charts and graphs) show pollution fluctuation across time and space.

Potential for integration of health statistics or anecdotal data (e.g., asthma reports).

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

GIS Mapping: Likely using ArcGIS tools.

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the dashboard UI.

Data Sources: OpenAQ, Sentinel-5P, local AQI APIs.

Design Tools: PowerPoint or Canva for storyboard/pitch.

üìà Potential Insights
Areas with consistently poor air quality.

Zones with high exposure and low healthcare access.

Seasonal or time-based pollution patterns.

Policy suggestions for greener infrastructure and citizen alerts.

**Project Description**

Developed a dashboard which  integrates  air quality data with GIS to visualize pollution impacts and track health trends. It provides actionable insights for communities and authorities to address environmental concerns.

**Map Integration**:
 A map that displays the locations of air quality monitoring stations, along with data on air quality levels in different regions.

**Air Quality Index (AQI):**
Display of the AQI for various pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, O3, etc., to give users a snapshot of air quality.

**Vulnerable Areas:** 
Helps to Identify  areas with high vulnerability, where air quality may have a larger health impact.
